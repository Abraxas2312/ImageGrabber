Image Grabber
====

A little Cordodva plugin which shall get all images from the library and return them with some data as JSON-Array. Enforced to be in a git-rep to install it. Or - and this probability should not be left outside before - I'm too stupid to solve it differently.

Aaaaaand yupp, I known, it's not perfect, it's only part of a prototype ...
